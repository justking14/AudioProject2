Uses Chunity I created a game about rain drops.

As the drops create waves along the water, the player must use their eyes and ears to avoid the ripples.

Use WASD to move the player, avoid the waves, and keep yourself from falling out of the water.

Also, I created 100 waves manually instead of instantiating, as this proved very difficult to do with the chuck sub instances
requiring a call to the chuck main instance.
